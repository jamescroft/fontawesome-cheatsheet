###Using this cheat sheet

Go check out the [published Font Awesome cheat sheet page](http://fontawesome.bootstrapcheatsheets.com).

###About

Font Awesome is great! It's one of my favourite add-ons to [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com). I've been working with these icons quite a lot, so I thought I'd make a cheat sheet for myself.

###Cheat sheet?

Yeah! It's basically a big grid with all the glyphicons on it. It's similar to the [official Font Awesome documentation](http://fontawesome.io/examples/), except [this cheat sheet](http://fontawesome.bootstrapcheatsheets.com) has some handy-dandy copy buttons.

To use it, simply find the icon you want to use on the page and click the copy button. That's it! This will add the complete HTML code, unicode, or CSS rule for that glyphicon to your clipboard, ready to paste into your web development tool of choice.

There is also a search box up top, so you can find an icon by keyword.

###What is Font Awesome exactly?
[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) is basically a library of little symbols, icons, or pictograms (whatever you prefer to call them) that you can use in a webpage, just like a font. If you're creating a site based on the current version (4.7.0), [you have access to 605 of them](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/).

Don't know how to set up Font Awesome? Go check out the [offical getting started guide](http://fontawesome.io/get-started).
